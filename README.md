# 💬 Digital Financial Awareness AI Agent

An AI-driven virtual assistant developed to empower users with secure and clear understanding of digital finance. Built using IBM Watsonx.ai and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, this assistant offers multilingual support and reliable insights on topics such as UPI safety, investment basics, interest rates, online frauds, financial planning, and more.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

A large portion of the population—especially those in rural areas or with limited digital exposure—faces challenges in managing money online. They may not understand UPI, fall for digital scams, or struggle with saving and budgeting. This digital gap increases the risk of fraud and financial exclusion.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The project introduces an AI assistant powered by IBM Watsonx.ai that provides document-grounded, easy-to-understand financial guidance. By combining RAG and multilingual NLP, users can ask questions and receive answers drawn from trusted sources like RBI, NPCI, or uploaded PDFs.
